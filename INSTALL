This README tells you how to install the wise2 on your
own system.


You have picked up the source distribution all you need to do cd into
src and type 'make all'. This should only fail if

a) You don't have a ANSI C compiler installed as cc.  In which case
see if you have gcc installated, and if so, edit the makefile in this
directory to say CC = gcc rather than CC = cc

b) You don't have a make program that allows recursion into
directories (some old Sun systems did this). Install gnu make.

c) If your copy of wise2 was downloaded via CVS, all the models
are written in dynamite and need to be compiled. To do that you need to
make dyc from an existing dynamite compiled system (ie, a tar ball from
the ftp site)


In the existing tar ball go:

-make all in src directory

-cd into dyc go make dyc

-on linux this will fail. Then go make linux


Now go:

-copy dyc somewhere on your path; setenv WISECONFIGDIR 
to $wise-cvs-home/wisecfg/

-cd into src in cvs sources

-go "make init"

-now you can go make all.

Installing with Pthreads support


To install with Pthreads, you need to edit the top of the makefile
in this directory. Basically you need to comment out the areas
it says (by adding a # at the start of hte line) and uncomment
the areas it says to uncomment. Then 'make all' should make it
fine.
