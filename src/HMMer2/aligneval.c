/* aligneval.c
 * 
 * Comparison of multiple alignments. Three functions are
 * provided, using subtly different scoring schemes:
 *    CompareMultAlignments()    - basic scoring scheme
 *    CompareRefMultAlignments() - only certain "canonical" columns 
 *                                 are scored
 *                                 
 * The similarity measure is a fractional alignment identity averaged
 * over all sequence pairs. The score for all pairs is:
 *      (identically aligned symbols) / (total aligned columns in 
 *      known alignment)
 *      
 * A column c is identically aligned for sequences i, j if:
 *    1) both i,j have a symbol aligned in column c, and the
 *       same pair of symbols is aligned somewhere in the test
 *       alignment
 *    2) S[i][c] is aligned to a gap in sequence j, and that symbol
 *       is aligned to a gap in the test alignment
 *    3) converse of 2)
 *    
 *    
 * The algorithm is as follows:
 *    1) For each known/test aligned pair of sequences (k1,k2 and t1,t2)
 *        construct a list for each sequence, in which for every
 *        counted symbol we record the raw index of the symbol in
 *        the other sequence that it aligns to, or -1 if it aligns
 *        to a gap or uncounted symbol.
 *        
 *    2)  Compare the list for k1 to the list for t1 and count an identity 
 *        for each correct alignment.
 *        
 *    3) Repeat 2) for comparing k2 to t2. Note that this means correct sym/sym
 *       alignments count for 2; correct sym/gap alignments count for 1.
 *    
 *    4) The score is (identities from 2 + identities from 3) / 
 *       (totals from 2 + totals from 3).
 *
 * Written originally for koala's ss2 pairwise alignment package.

/* Function: ComparePairAlignments
 * 
 * Purpose:  Calculate and return a number representing how well two different alignments
 *           of a pair of sequences compare. The number is, roughly speaking,
 *           the fraction of columns which are identically aligned.
 * 
 *           For all columns c in which either known1[c] or known2[c] 
 *           is a non-gap, count an identity if those same symbols are
 *           aligned somewhere in calc1/calc2. The score is identities/total
 *           columns examined. (i.e. fully gapped columns don't count)
 * 
 *           more explicitly, identities come from:
 *             both known and test aligned pairs have the same symbol in the first sequence aligned to
 *               a gap in the second sequence;
 *             both known and test aligned pairs have the same symbol in the second sequence
 *               aligned to a gap in the first sequence;
 *             the known alignment has symbols aligned at this column, and the test
 *               alignment aligns the same two symbols.
 * 
 * Args:     known1, known2: trusted alignment of two sequences
 *           calc1, calc2:   test alignment of two sequences
 *  
 * Return:   Returns -1.0 on internal failure.
