These directories have the source code for the
Wise2 package and the Dynamite compiler. The 
directories are as follows.



base      - base memory, string and error reporting library

dynlibsrc - bioinformatics library - sequences, genes, codon tables
            etc

models    - algorithms and more complex objects for the wise2 package

dyc       - dynamite compiler source code.

HMMer2    - the HMMer2 package - used for hmmio in this case
	The source code here was provided by Sean Eddy <eddy@wol.wustl.edu>

perl      - Integration into perl via an XS interface: makefile for the interface

perl/Wise2 - the actual Perl 'directory' to compiled for it

perl/Wise2/libs - where the libraries are copied into to build perl

examples  - examples for the Wise2 package

dynamite_examples - examples for the Dynamite package.



Source code files:

	There is a scary number of files in each directory. This is
because the dynamite compiler generates alot files for each module
here is an explanation of the files

	.dy - the dynamite source

For each .dy files the following files are generated

	.h - C header file - contains documentation
	.c - C source file
	_api.t api 'type' file
	_api.h api header file
	.pod - pod documentation
	.xs - xs interface into perl



More documentation occurs in a appropiate file. Read the .h  files for
each module
